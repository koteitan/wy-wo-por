Por.BMS.Search: the specification of `greatestBelow?`, the parent as a search, the
characterizations of `entry?`, `entryLt` and `expansionPivot?`, and the head decomposition
of `Relation.TransGen`.

Written independently. The statements (names, binders, binder names) are fixed by how the
imported 0-Y / 1-Y core (Phyrion1343/1Y-Well-Ordering-Lean, `formalization/{ZeroY,OneY}`,
Apache-2.0) calls them. Lean core only; no Mathlib.
