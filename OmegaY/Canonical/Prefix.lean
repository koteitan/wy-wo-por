# front preservation of actual successful canonical builds

The statements below concern the executable `buildFrom` / `build`.  They do
not assume success for arbitrary legal inputs.  If a build succeeds, its input
can be split into the same successful front build followed by the suffix;
all existing columns, including values and stored references, are preserved.
