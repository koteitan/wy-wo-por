# Correctness of canonical candidate search

`FirstSmaller` follows the actual executable Q steps and records every rejected
candidate.  The column-derived search allowance is sufficient for every such
finite first-smaller search.  This proves that this allowance does not discard
an existing answer; it does not yet prove that an answer exists for every node
of every legal-input mountain.
