# The shape of the leg atoms

Every leg atom of a valid mountain is well formed (`Reserve.wellFormed`): its parent
column is left of its child column, its child is a column of the mountain, its key
has `D + 1` entries, and every column entry of the key is at most the parent.
Canonical mountains are valid (`Canonical.build_valid_of_success`), so this holds
for the mountain of every legal sequence.
