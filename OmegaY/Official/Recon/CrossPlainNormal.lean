# The cross case in a normal frame

`CrossLexHolds` (`CrossLex.lean`) is a statement about the output mountain of an expansion.
This file proves the same statement in a **normal frame** (`Frame.Normal`, Phyrion's exact
local rules: every real node with a node above has its stored parent equal to the numerical
parent `P`, the row law `row u⁺ = B(row u, row P u)` and the value law
`v(u⁺) = v(u) - v(P u)`). Every canonical mountain `M(s)` is normal
(`Canonical.build_normal_of_success`), so this is the statement for the input mountain.

Let `s₀` be a real node with a node `s⁺` above it, `p = π(s⁺)` its stored parent and
`q₀ = Q s₀` its candidate. For every chain of stored parents `q₀ → … → c` with `π(c⁺) = p`
(`normal_crossLex`):

* `v(s₀) ≤ v(c)`: along the chain the canonical search from `q₀` with the threshold `v(s₀)`
  is not finished (`chain_facts`, by the determinism of the search, `Hit.unique`);
* `row c⁺ = row s⁺`: the rows above the chain do not decrease (Phyrion's father upper
  bound `father_upper_bound`), so `row s₀ < row q₀⁺ ≤ row c⁺`; with
  `row p ≤ row c ≤ row s₀` the two rows `B(row c, row p)` and `B(row s₀, row p)` are equal
  (`Row.B_eq_of_between`);
* `Lex s⁺ c⁺`: in a normal frame the comparison `Lex` follows from the values
  (`lex_of_value_le`): the parents of two nodes with the same stored left end and row are
  found by the same search, with the smaller threshold stopping at or after the larger one.

No hypothesis beyond `Frame.Normal` is used.
