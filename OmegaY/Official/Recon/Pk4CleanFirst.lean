# `CleanFirst`: a copy of the root row without the cut flag is the first emit of its origin

`CleanFirst` (`CrossPlainPosColumn.lean`) is one of the open statements of the reduction of
`CrossLexPos IsClean`. This file proves it, for every column of every splice run
(`emitsT_first`, for any context; `cleanFirst_holds`), by an induction over the items
(notes/03 §2.3, §2.4) next to `ChainCorr.Inner.runItemT_order`.

For the list `ps` of emits of an item `it` of level `d` the induction carries

* `FirstClean ps`: no emit of `ps` before an emit `.clean r false` has the source `r`;
* `CutInv`: (B) if `it` copies a root row and has the cut flag, every emit of `ps` is
  `.clean _ true`; (C) if `it` copies no root row, has the cut flag and `d ≥ 2`, and `ρ` is the
  top of the root column in the region of `it`, no emit `.clean r' false` of `ps` has the row of
  `ρ`.

The step: the children of an item are pairwise separated (`ChildSep`, from
`childItems_order`) in one of three ways, and in each the later child has no `.clean r false`
emit whose source is a source of the earlier child (`sep_first`):

* by slots: the rows of the two children differ;
* the later child copies the same root row with the cut flag: all its emits are cut (B);
* the later child is a cut item without a root row above the root row `C` of the earlier one:
  its emits are at or above `C` (`EmitOK`), those at `C` are not `.clean _ false` (C), and the
  emits of the earlier one are at or below `C`.

(B) and (C) pass from the children to the item by the shape of the children
(`childItems_cut`): a cut copy of a root row has only cut copies of the same root row as
children (case 4), and a cut item without a root row (case 3) has cut copies of the root row,
items above the slot of `ρ`, and (for `d ≥ 1`) one cut item without a root row in the slot of
`ρ`, whose region has the same top `ρ` of the root column (`topIn_slot`).
