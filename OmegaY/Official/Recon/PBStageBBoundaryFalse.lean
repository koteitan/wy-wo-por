# `Boundary` is false (root column `0`)

`Boundary` (`ParentBelowLowerProfile.lean`) asks that the hypothetical copy of the root column
`c_r` in a block `i ≥ 1` runs without error (`∃ es, lowerT … = .ok es`) and emits every row
below `τ` of the boundary column `c_r + w·i`. When `c_r = 0` the copy fails: the root column
`0` has only its bottom node (the first entry is `1`), and that node has no left end
(`BottomLegs`: the bottom of column `0` has `left = none`). The copy of the bottom row is a
clean copy of the root row `0` (as in every copied column), and `levelOneT` then calls
`leftColumn` on the bottom node of column `0`, which is an error.

The smallest example is `s = (1,3)`, `n = 1`, `i = 1` (`c_r = 0`, `x₀ = 1`). `bndCheck` evaluates
the rule on it; it is checked by `#guard` (compiled evaluation: `List.mergeSort` in
`Expansion.finish` does not reduce in the kernel), as `legCheck` in
`ParentBelowLowerLeg.lean`. `not_boundary_of_check` turns the check into a refutation of
`Boundary`.

For `c_r ≥ 1` the statement holds (`BoundaryPos`, proved as `boundaryPos` in
`PBStageBBndSim.lean`).
