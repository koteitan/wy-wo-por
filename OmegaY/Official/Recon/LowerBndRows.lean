# Rows of the source mountain near a leg into the root column

Facts of the canonical mountain `M(s)` used by `LowerBndFirst.lean`, all from the jump law of
the canonical mountain (`JumpLaw.source_edge`: the row of a node is `bump σ (jump σ p)` for the
row `σ` below it and the highest row `p` of its leg column below it):

* `root_row_of_leg`: if a node `u` of a column has its leg in the column `c_r` and its row
  agrees with `θ = bump λ (d + 1)` at the exponents `≥ d + 1`, and the column of `u` has a row
  agreeing with `λ` there, then `c_r` has a row agreeing with `λ` at the exponents `≥ d + 1`.
* `pred_rows`: a column with a row `r` has the rows `r - k`, `k ≤ r_0` (only the finite
  coefficient changes).
* `leg_pred_row`: if a node with finite coefficient `m + 1` has its leg in `c_r`, then `c_r` has
  the row with finite coefficient `m` and the same higher coefficients.
* `x0_ascends`: the last column ascends at every node of the root column below `τ`.
