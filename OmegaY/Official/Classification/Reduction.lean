# Reduction of the classification lemma to the splice branch

`Descent.ClassificationHolds` quantifies over every list, including `[]`. At `[]` it
is false: `Official.expand [] n = .ok []`, and `classifiedB` then asks for
`out.length + 1 = s.length`, i.e. `1 = 0` (`not_classificationHolds`). The
well-foundedness proof only uses the classification at nonempty lists (a `Step`
starts from a nonempty list), so this file states the corrected lemma
`ClassificationHoldsNonempty` and proves well-foundedness from it
(`wellFounded_of_classificationNonempty`, the same argument as
`Descent.wellFounded_of_classification`).

It then proves every part of `classifiedB` that does not depend on how the official
rule copies a column:

* the deletion branch (the last entry is `1`, or `n = 0`) completely;
* in the splice branch, the (base) part: every output leg atom with child `< x₀` is
  an input leg atom (`Locality.lean`).

What is left is stated as four propositions about the splice branch (`SpliceCase`):
the output mountain can be built (`OutputBuilds`), its degrees stay below `D`
(`DegreePreserved`), its length is `x₀ + n·w` (`LengthOK`), and every output leg atom
with child `≥ x₀` is a (reserve) or (seam) atom (`SpliceAtomsClassified`).
`classificationHoldsNonempty_of` assembles them.
