# The first item of the root row (`TSQ`, `BiTopLow`)

A statement about rows only. Let `τ = B(a, b)` (the row law of the top `t` of the last column,
`a = row t⁻`, `b = row r`), and let a first item `F = (k + 1, S)` (`S = slot (k + 2) τ j`,
`j < τ_k`) contain a row `C` with `b ≤ C < τ`. Then

* `b` is in `F` (`root_mem_first`);
* every row `r < τ` outside `F` is below every row of `F` (`below_first`).

With `J = jump(a, b)`: `τ_m = a_m = b_m` for `m > J`, `τ_J = a_J + 1 = b_J + 1`, `τ_m = 0` for
`m < J`. So `k ≥ J` (`τ_k > 0`), and `k > J` would put `b` above `C`. Hence `k = J` and
`j = b_J`: `F` is the region of `b` of level `J + 1`, and it reaches up to `τ`.
