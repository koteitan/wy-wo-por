# `CutPaRow`: the node `pa` of a copy of the root row is at the row of the origin

`CutPaRow` (`CutPartsStart.lean`) says: for a gap copy with origin `o = (x, C)` and leg `l`,
the highest node `pa` of the column `l` of `M(s)` at or below the row of `o` is at that row.
This file proves it for every copy of the root row (`b = 0` or `b = 1`, `paRow_of_clean`),
hence `CutPaRow` (`cutPaRow`).

## The argument

The origin `(x, C)` of a copy of the root row passed its ascension test
(`ChainCorrCutLeg.lean`): the node `a = (x, Z)` at the reference row `Z` of `C` exists and the
in-row parents from `a` reach the column `cr` exactly. Also `C` is the row of a node of the
root column (the top `ρ` of the root column in the region, `LegJump.CleanTop`;
`emitsT_cleanRow`).

* If the finite coefficient of `C` is `0`, then `Z = C`, `a = (x, C)`, and its in-row parent
  `q` is its raw parent, at the row `C`. In a canonical mountain the parent search for the node
  above `u` starts at the highest node of the leg column of `u` at or below the row of `u` and
  the rows along the search do not increase (`Frame.Hit.height_le`,
  `ControlProof.Q_of_highestAtMost`), so `row q ≤ row pa` (`rawParent_row_le_hAM`). With
  `row pa ≤ C = row q`, `row pa = C`.
* Otherwise `Z = C - 1`, `(x, C)` is the node above `a`, and its leg is `q = P(a)`, at the row
  `Z`. If `q` is right of `cr`, the in-row parents continue from `q`: the node above `q` exists
  and is at the row `bump Z 0 = C` (the row law). If `q` is in the root column, the node of the
  root column at the row `C` exists by `CleanTop`. Either way the column `l` has a node at the
  row `C`, so `row pa = C`.
