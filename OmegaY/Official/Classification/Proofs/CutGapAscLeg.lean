# The leg of a node passes the ascension test of its row (`CutGap`)

`ascLeg`: in a canonical mountain, let `C` be a row, `x > cr`, `(x, C)` a node whose leg `l`
(the left end of the edge into `(x, C)`) is right of `cr`, and let `x` pass the ascension test of
`C` (the in-row parents from `(x, Z)`, `Z` the reference row of `C`, reach the column `cr`
exactly). Then `l` passes the same test.

* If the finite coefficient of `C` is positive, `Z = C - 1`, `(x, C)` is the node above
  `(x, Z)` and its leg is the in-row parent `q = P(x, Z)` (the row law), so the test from `l` is
  the rest of the test from `x`.
* Otherwise `Z = C` and `q = P(x, C)` is the raw parent of `(x, C)`, at the row `C`. The parent
  search for the node above `(x, C)` starts at the node `Q` of the leg column at or below `C`
  and reaches `q` by numerical parents (`Frame.Hit.parentPath`). The rows along this path lie
  between `row q = C` and `row Q ≤ C`, so all are `C`: `Q` is the node `(l, C)` and every step is
  an in-row parent. The test from `l` follows the path to `q` and then the test from `x`.
