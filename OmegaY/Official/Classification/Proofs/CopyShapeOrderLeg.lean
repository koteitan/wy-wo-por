# `CopyOrder` is false; the two forms its users need

`ChainCorr.CopyOrder` (`ChainCorrStartCopy.lean`) compares non-cut emits of any two columns
`y`, `y'` of a block `i ≥ 1`. It is false (`CopyShapeMAFalse.lean`): for
`s = (1,3,6,13,15,13)`, `n = 1`, block `1`, the node `(3,ω)` is copied to row `ω·2` and the node
`(4,ω)` to row `ω`. The column `4` does not ascend in the region `[0, ω²)` although it has the
node `(4,ω)` above the root top `(2,2)` (this is where (MA) fails), so `(4,ω)` keeps its row,
while `(3,ω)` is lifted.

Every use of `CopyOrder` in the project compares two emits in one of two shapes:

* **the same column** (`CutPartsTop.lean`, `CutPartsStart.lean`): `CopyOrderSame`, proved in
  `CopyShapeNoMA.lean` (`copyOrderSame`), with no hypothesis;
* **a column `y` and the leg column `l` of the origin `v` of the emit of `y`**
  (`ChainCorrStartCopy.lean`, `StepInnerLookupLeg.lean`, `LegParts*.lean`,
  `StartRootPartsCutTop.lean`, `ChainCorrStartLegJump.lean`; there `l = cv.left.column` or
  `pa.column` with `pa` the highest node of `l` at or below `v`, and `cr < l`): this is
  `CopyOrderLeg` below. It is proved in `CopyShapeOrderLegProof.lean`
  (`ProfileLeg.copyOrderLeg`, no hypothesis).

In the counterexample the failing pairs are not of the second shape: the left end of `(4,ω)` is
`(0,0)`, left of `c_r = 2`.

## Numerical evidence for `CopyOrderLeg`

`reference/official/copy-order-leg.cjs` (check `COlegcol`: for each non-cut emit `e` of a block
column `y` with origin `u`, the leg column `l` of `u` (the left end of `u`, or `y - 1` for a
bottom node) when `l` is a block column, and every non-cut emit `f` of `l`: the rows of `e` and
`f` compare like the rows of their origins). The counts are in the report of this task; no
failure was found, while the unrestricted `CopyOrder` (`COpairs`) fails on the counterexample.
