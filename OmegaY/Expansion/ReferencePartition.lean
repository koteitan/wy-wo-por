# Exact selection from a partition of actual references

The real referenceAt loop selects the final qualifying read. A successful
boundary mapM supplies the corresponding list partition; every later boundary
at or below the requested row produces a strictly lower, ineligible reference.
No root-boundary partition or referenceAt success is assumed implicitly.
