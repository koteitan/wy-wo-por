# Recognition of actual weak-edge paths

A weak edge is the actual operation `lower.above.left` with equal endpoint
heights. The executable check in `weakParent` also enforces leftwardness. This
file proves that the backwards marker search recognizes exactly finite paths
of these edges, using the source column itself as a sufficient allowance.
It does not assume an abstract marker oracle or a bound on mountain height.
